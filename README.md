# Scrape-Instagram-Images
Downloads post details (captions, likes, number of comments) and photos from a public Instagram account.

The directory 'inst_account' contains folders with the images and data (csv) per account.

Future improvements: Currently only downloads the first image from a multi-imaged post.
